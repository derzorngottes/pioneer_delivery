        <h2>Fast Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          You've never seen ordering this quick. Ou proprietary rocket ship delivery team allows you to spend less time being hungry, and more time doing what matters most to you. We'd ask what that is, but gFood respects your privacy.

        <h2>Great Deals</h2>
        <p>
          Money: you've got it, we want it. But let it never be said we're not incredibly fair! Burger sales? Check. Pizza sales? Check. Burger and pizza sales?? Check, check, check! We seriously can't stop making deals.
